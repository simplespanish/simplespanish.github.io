Simple Spanish has come a long way over the last few months and I owe it all to you. Thank you all for trusting me as your teacher and for all your support!  
As we grow, we’re developing a list of benefits and policy structure. Some of the benefits are: referral bonuses, preferred scheduling and Sunday classes. Check them out here on the website so you don't miss any! 
You can also look at the updated policies on the website. The most important one that I want to share with you is the cancellation and rescheduling policy - to ensure that there’s always availability for each and every one of you, I really appreciate 24 hour notice for a rescheduling.  
It's being an amazing journey so far and I’m learning as I go. I will always try to be flexible with all my students and I appreciate everyone working with me too!
Saludos, 
Marta
